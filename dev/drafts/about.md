#The Short Version

Hello! My name is Lief Swanson. I am a student of software engineering and user centric design. I am nearly finished a double major at SFU for both of these disciplines. One thing people often note about me is I am an information sponge. I try to learn things no matter what I am doing, and I have a knack for applying the knowledge I collect in novel ways.

#My Education

I have been going to SFU (Simon Fraser University) for about eight years. The reason it has been so long is in addition to a couple of set backs in my personal life, I am going for two degrees, a BSc from a program called SoSy (Software Systems) and a BA in a program called IAT Interactive Arts and Technology.

I don't like to think of myself as just a software engineer or a UX/UI designer, but rather as mashup of the two. Though, to be fair my skills probably lie a little closer to the computer science side of things.

I am also working on publishing some self-directed research and I have volunteered in a few labs helping complete other people's research.

#Skills

I spend a lot of time on my computer, for both work and play. So as a necessity I have built up quite the arsenal of skills with a computer.
I am always teaching myself new skills; be it a new programming language, a new design tool, or some little application or trick for KDE & Arch Linux. Here is an incomplete list of some of the tools I have used frequently enough in the recent past to be comfortable with.

#Hobbies

Swimming is a thing I love to do in order to relax and get some exercise. I am not much for land sports, but in the water I feel right at home. I can swim laps for literally hours, while I just think about things.

I am pretty big on video games, especially ones that provide an intellectual challenge or a story worthy of escapism. My top five games of all time are:
1. The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt
2. Total War Shogun 2
3. Grim Dawn
4. Minecraft (modded beyond recognition)
5. Planetary Annihilation

I have dyslexia, so I can find reading for very long periods exhausting. However, that doesn't stop me from enjoying a good book! I have listened to a pretty good selection of audio books. My top five are nearly impossible to pick... but here are five really good ones:
1. The Etymologicon by Mark Forsyth
2. A History of the World in 6 Glasses by Tom Standage
3. Misbehaving by Richard Thaler
4. The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins
5. Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky, Peter R. Mitchell, and John Schoeffel

I also like movies, TV shows, and YouTube videos; sometimes even bad ones! I won't give you a list of my top five... but my favourite movie of all time is Cloud Atlas by The Wachowskis. There is something about the way the story is told in combination with the reuse of actors, cinematography, and editing that I think makes it a true masterpiece; even if most people don't agree.
