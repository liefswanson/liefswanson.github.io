            If the above looks familiar to you, then you know how unreliable gesture typing is in apps like Gboard and SwiftKey.
            I use gesture typing regularly, because it offers speed while not restricting vocabulary the way predictive methods do.
            I decided I would solve this unreliability by finding a keyboard layout designed specifically for gesture typing, because it is important to my own user experience.

            What my role was

        <p class='p-wide p-text'>
            I had the project ideas, did the research into existing work, created the theory &amp; algorithms, and implemented the software required to test a new method of optimizing keyboard layouts for gesture clarity.
            This new method is designed to be extremely fast by comparison to existing methods, because it is intended to run on a phone and use an individual userâ€™s vocabulary, so a keyboard layout is found for <strong>you</strong> not for the language you speak.

           I had the opportunity to follow an idea all the way from inception to empirical testing.
