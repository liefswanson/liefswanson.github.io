            Optimizing Gesture Keyboards for Clarity, Done Dirt Cheap

            If the above looks familiar to you, then you know how unreliable
            <v-link to='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obAlmLLD0O0'>gesture typing</v-link>
            is in apps like
            <v-link to='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin'>Gboard</v-link>
            and
            <v-link to='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey'>SwiftKey</v-link>.
            I use gesture typing regularly, because it offers speed while not restricting vocabulary the way predictive input methods do.
            I decided I would improve this shortcoming of gesture typing by finding a method for optimizing keyboard layouts specifically to reduce error rates.

            What my role was

        <p class='p-wide p-text'>
            I had the project ideas, did the research into existing work, created the theory &amp; algorithms, and implemented the software required to test a new method of optimizing keyboard layouts for gesture clarity.
            This new method is designed to be extremely fast by comparison to existing methods, because it is intended to run on a phone and use an individual userâ€™s vocabulary, so a keyboard layout is found for <strong>you</strong> not for the language you speak.
