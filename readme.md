A reminder to myself: how to add a new project...
- add to ProjectItems.ts, along with an thumbnail for the card
- add a vue component under projects
- use the src/components/util/ProjectTemplate.vue, and slot content into that
- any images used inside the new project should use the PreallocatedImage.vue component, to stop load jumping
